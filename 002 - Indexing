# PART 2:

## INDEXING

	- The process of inserting documents is called ** indexing **. 
	- It is a very slow process (comparatively)
	- ### The data is ingested by the ES and undergoes text analysis
		- Text analysis is made of 2 parts
			- a. * Tokenising *
				- Tokenises the entire document
			- b. * Filtering *
				- Post tokenising, the following procedure is followed
				 - Stemming: Gets the root of the word. Eg: 'Running' and 'runners' share the same root 'run'
				 - Removal of stop words: Commonly used words/articles like 'a', 'an', 'the' etc.
				 - Lowercasing: Since ES is case sensitive
				 - Synonyms: As the name suggests
	
	- Post indexation, an inverted index is created.
	- This inverted index is now stored inside a memory cache
	- The memory cache in put in a shard.
